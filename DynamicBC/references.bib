abstract = {It is known that the Van der Waals-Cahn-Hilliard (W-C-H) dynamics can be approximated by a Quasi-static Stefan problem with surface tension. It turns out that the Stefan problem has a manifold of equilibria equal in dimension to that of the domain Omega: any sphere of fixed radius with interface contained in the domain is an equilibrium (indistinguishable from the point of view of the perimeter functional). We resolve this degeneracy by showing that at the W-C-H level this manifold is replaced by a quasi-invariant stable manifold, on which the typical solution preserves its "bubble" like shape until it reaches the boundary. Moreover, we show that the "bubble" moves superslowly. We also obtain an equation that determines those special spheres that correspond to equilibria at the W-C-H level. Our work establishes the phenomenon of superslow motion in higher space dimensions in the class of single interface solutions.},

This method, called dynamical decoupling, is known to work for bounded interactions, but physical environments such as bosonic heat baths are usually modelled with unbounded interactions, whence here we initiate a systematic study of dynamical decoupling for unbounded operators. We develop a sufficient decoupling criterion for arbitrary Hamiltonians and a necessary decoupling criterion for semibounded Hamiltonians. We give examples for unbounded Hamiltonians where decoupling works and the limiting evolution as well as the convergence speed can be explicitly computed. We show that decoupling does not always work for unbounded interactions and provide both physically and mathematically motivated examples.},

First we prove the well-posedness and some regularity results for the phase-field type state systems modified by the state-feedback control laws. Then, we show that the chosen SMC laws force the system to reach within finite time the sliding manifold (that we chose in order that one of the physical variables or a combination of them remains constant in time). We study three different types of feedback control laws: the first one appears in the internal energy balance and forces a linear combination of the temperature and the phase to reach a given (space dependent) value, while the second and third ones are added in the phase relation and lead the phase onto a prescribed target. While the control law is non-local in space for the first two problems, it is local in the third one, i.e., its value at any point and any time just depends on the value of the state.},

Other spectral results are obtained as well. Steady state solutions for the CH equation with no flux or periodic boundary conditions are also stationary states for the bistable reaction-diffusion equation and the PF system (with constant temperature). Thus, it is meaningful to linearize each of these equations about a common stationary solution and discuss the stability of this state in each dynamical process. Converting the linearized operators to self-adjoint form and expressing eigenvalues in terms of modified Rayleigh quotients enables us to relate the spectra of the three operators. In particular we relate the indices of instability with respect to the three processes. We also discuss the change in the spectrum of the linearized CH operator in one dimension when we change the stationary solution at which it is linearized. We conjecture that the eigenvalues increase with the number of oscillations of the steady state for a given mass, and prove that this is so in certain cases. This lends credence to the idea that motion of these dynamical systems near coarse solutions takes place on longer time scales. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

A non-linear constitutive equation for the heat flux vector is proposed as a more accurate description of heat flow at low temperatures. In the linear theory, it is shown that an exact equation, governing dilatational wave propagation, must be used for certain real materials. The corresponding approximate equation deduced by Lord and Shulman [1] predicts unstable lower order waves. The strong dilatational shock equations are completed for the extended heat conduction law. Dilatational constant profile waves are studied and used to discuss the shock structure of the dilatational non-heat conducting shock. Two methods for predicting the breakdown of the constant profile wave solution are compared. Both methods coincide in their estimation of the strain that would cause the breakdown. Some conclusions are drawn for real materials. {\textcopyright} 1973 Springer-Verlag.},

Using decay instability caused by the three-wave parametric interactions of the variations of the arbitrary higher harmonics and the fundamental mode of NRSW along the surface boundary, we find that the steady propagation of the higher harmonics of NRSW can be described by Jacobi elliptic functions, that can qualitatively explain the numerical-simulation solutions. Our study suggests that the excited higher harmonics of NRSW may inversely cascade to the lower harmonics due to the three-wave parametric decay instability within the quadratic nonlinearity of the deformation gradients.},

abstract = {We present a new phase-field model for binary fluids, exhibiting typical signatures of soft-glassy behavior, such as long-time relaxation, aging, and long-term dynamical arrest. The present model allows the cost of building an interface to vanish locally within the interface, while preserving positivity of the overall surface tension. A crucial consequence of this property, which we prove analytically, is the emergence of free-energy minimizing density configurations, hereafter named "compactons," to denote their property of being localized to a finite-size region of space and strictly zero elsewhere (no tails). Thanks to compactness, any arbitrary superposition of compactons still is a free-energy minimizer, which provides a direct link between the complexity of the free-energy landscape and the morphological complexity of configurational space. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Cascading failure in electric power systems is a complicated problem for which a variety of models, software tools, and analytical tools have been proposed but are difficult to verify. Benchmarking and validation are necessary to understand how closely a particular modeling method corresponds to reality, what engineering conclusions may be drawn from a particular tool, and what improvements need to be made to the tool in order to reach valid conclusions. The community needs to develop the test cases tailored to cascading that are central to practical benchmarking and validation. In this paper, the IEEE PES working group on cascading failure reviews and synthesizes how benchmarking and validation can be done for cascading failure analysis, summarizes and reviews the cascading test cases that are available to the international community, and makes recommendations for improving the state of the art.},

In the critical growth case, we prove that the problems are locally well posed and obtain a bootstrapping procedure showing that the solutions are classical. For p = 2 and almost critical dissipative nonlinearities we prove global well posedness, existence of global attractors in H01($\Omega$) and, uniformly with respect to the viscosity parameter, L∞($\Omega$) bounds for the attractors. Finally, we obtain a result on continuity of regular attractors which shows that, if n = 3, 4, the attractor of the Cahn-Hilliard problem coincides (in a sense to be specified) with the attractor for the corresponding semilinear heat equation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We are interested in the study of the asymptotic behavior, in terms of finite-dimensional attractors, of the dynamical system associated with the problem. The main difficulty here is that we no longer have the conservation of mass, i.e., of the spatial average of the order parameter c, as in the Cahn–Hilliard system. Instead, we prove that the spatial average of c is dissipative. We finally give numerical simulations which confirm and extend previous ones on the efficiency of the binary model.},

We assume that the system is confined in a vessel with nonpermeable walls and the total mass, in the bulk and on the boundary, is conserved. As a result, the well-posedness in the sense of distributions may not hold and new notions of solutions are required. The same problem has been analyzed, relying on duality techniques, under weak assumptions on the nonlinearities. We improve these results by introducing a variational formulation of the problem, based on a proper variational inequality. Bibliography: 26 titles.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The well-known Cahn-Hilliard equation entails mass conservation if a suitable boundary condition is prescribed. In the case when the equation is also coupled with a dynamic boundary condition, including the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the boundary, the total mass on the inside of the domain and its trace on the boundary should be conserved. The new issue of this paper is the setting of a mass constraint on the boundary. The effect of this additional constraint is the appearance of a Lagrange multiplier; in fact, two Lagrange multipliers arise, one for the bulk, the other for the boundary. The well-posedness of the resulting Cahn-Hilliard system with dynamic boundary condition and mass constraint on the boundary is obtained. The theory of evolution equations governed by subdifferentials is exploited and a complete characterization of the solution is given.},

In the case when the equation is also coupled with a dynamic boundary condition, including the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the boundary, the total mass on the inside of the domain and its trace on the boundary should be conserved. The new issue of this paper is the setting of a mass constraint on the boundary. The effect of this additional constraint is the appearance of a Lagrange multiplier; in fact, two Lagrange multipliers arise, one for the bulk, the other for the boundary. The well-posedness of the resulting Cahn-Hilliard system with dynamic boundary condition and mass constraint on the boundary is obtained. The theory of evolution equations governed by subdifferentials is exploited and a complete characterization of the solution is given.},

We tackle the problem of well-posedness via a penalization method using Robin boundary conditions. In particular, for the relaxation problem, the strong well-posedness and long-time behaviour of solutions can be shown for more general and possibly nonlinear relations. New difficulties arise since the surface variable is no longer the trace of the bulk variable, and uniform estimates in the relaxation parameter are scarce. Nevertheless, weak convergence to the original problem with affine linear relations can be shown. Using the approach of Colli and Fukao (2015), we show strong existence to the original problem with affine linear relations, and derive an error estimate between solutions to the relaxed and original problems.},

abstract = {Existence and uniqueness are investigated for a nonlinear diffusion problem of phase-field type, consisting of a parabolic system of two partial differential equations, complemented by Neumann homogeneous boundary conditions and initial conditions. This system aims to model two-species phase segregation on an atomic lattice (Podio-Guidugli, 2006 [19]); in the balance equations of microforces and microenergy, the two unknowns are the order parameter $\rho$ and the chemical potential $\mu$. A simpler version of the same system has recently been discussed in Colli et al. (2011) [8]. In this paper, a fairly more general phase-field equation for $\rho$ is coupled with a genuinely nonlinear diffusion equation for $\mu$. The existence of a global-in-time solution is proved with the help of suitable a priori estimates. In the case of a constant atom mobility, a new and rather unusual uniqueness proof is given, based on a suitable combination of variables. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

The resulting coupled system is shown to have smooth solutions at all values of parameters, in two spatial dimensions. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2007.},

For strong shocks we obtain peak stresses, strain rates, and rise times. From these data, we directly validate the invariance of the dissipative action in the strong shock regime, and by comparing with data obtained at much lower strain rates show that this invariance is observed over at least 5 orders of magnitude in the strain rate. Over the same range, we similarly validate the fourth-power scaling of the strain rate with the peak stress (the Swegle-Grady relation). {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

We experiment with two very different grapheme-to-phoneme variant predic- tion techniques and analyze the variants generated, as well as their effect when used within fairly standard ASR and STD sys- tems with unweighted lexicons. Specifically, we compare the variants generated by joint sequence models, which use prob- abilistic information to generate as many or as few variants as required, with a more discrete approach: the use of pseudo- phonemes within the default-and-refine algorithm. We evalu- ate results using three of the 2013 Babel evaluation languages with quite different variant characteristics – Tagalog, Pashto and Turkish – and find that there are clear trends in how the number and type of variants influence performance, and that the impli- cations for lexicon creation for ASR and STD are different.},

In the present study, we examined whether the whole-brain LIPUS (low-intensity pulsed ultrasound) therapy is effective and safe in 2 mouse models of dementia (vascular dementia, VaD and Alzheimer's disease, AD), and if so, to elucidate the common underlying mechanism(s) involved. Methods: We used bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) model with micro-coils in male C57BL/6 mice as a VaD model and 5XFAD transgenic mice as an AD model. We applied the LIPUS therapy (1.875 MHz, 6.0 kHz, 32cycles) to the whole brain. Results: In both models, the LIPUS therapy markedly ameliorated cognitive impairments (Y-maze test and/or passive avoidance test) associated with improved cerebral blood flow (CBF). Mechanistically, the LIPUS therapy significantly increased CD31-positive endothelial cells and Olig2-positive oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in the VaD model, while it reduced Iba-1-positive microglias and amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) plaque in the AD model. In both models, endothelium-related genes were significantly upregulated in RNA-sequencing, and expressions of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and neurotrophins were upregulated in Western blotting. Interestingly, the increases in glia cells and neurotrophin expressions showed significant correlations with eNOS expression. Importantly, these beneficial effects of LIPUS were absent in eNOS-knockout mice. Conclusions: These results indicate that the whole-brain LIPUS is an effective and non-invasive therapy for dementia by activating specific cells corresponding to each pathology, for which eNOS activation plays an important role as a common mechanism.},

abstract = {The viscous Cahn-Hilliard equation may be viewed as a singular limit of the phase-field equations for phase transitions. It contains both the Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard models of phase separation as particular cases; by specific choices of parameters it may be formulated as a one-parameter (say $\alpha$) homotopy connecting the Cahn-Hilliard ($\alpha$ = 0) and Allen-Cahn ($\alpha$=1) models. The limit $\alpha$ = 0 is singular in the sense that the smoothing property of the analytic semigroup changes from being of the type associated with second order operators to the type associated with fourth order operators. The properties of the gradient dynamical system generated by the viscous Cahn-Hilliard equation are studied as $\alpha$ varies in [0, 1]. Continuity of the phase portraits near equilibria is established independently of $\alpha$ ∈ [0, 1] and, using this, a piecewise, uniform in time, perturbation result is proved for trajectories. Finally the continuity of the attractor is established and, in one dimension, the existence and continuity of inertial manifolds shown and the flow on the attractor detailed. {\textcopyright} 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

Although the development of quantum computers in the near future may enable us to compute energy spectra of classically-intractable systems, methods to simulate the Green's function with near-term quantum algorithms have not been proposed yet. Here, we propose two methods to calculate the Green's function of a given Hamiltonian on near-term quantum computers. The first one makes use of a variational dynamics simulation of quantum systems and computes the dynamics of the Green's function in real time directly. The second one utilizes the Lehmann representation of the Green's function and a method which calculates excited states of the Hamiltonian. Both methods require shallow quantum circuits and are compatible with near-term quantum computers. We numerically simulated the Green's function of the Fermi-Hubbard model and demonstrated the validity of our proposals.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Starting from a master equation for a stochastic lattice gas we obtain evolution equations on the single-particle level, whose stationary solutions in principle are consistent with the exact equilibrium statistics. Our method, which generalizes an approach proposed earlier, is based on a combination of a local equilibrium assumption and the lattice version of classical density functional theory. In the continuum limit, which is worked out for attractive interactions, generalized Cahn-Hilliard-type equations are recovered. Microscopic kinetic coefficients can be identified, which in general depend on the instantaneous local correlations in the nonequilibrium state. Moreover we study semi-infinite systems interacting with a planar wall and derive the appropriate boundary conditions to be imposed on the continuum equations. Applications to problems of the kinetics of phase changes influenced by a near wall are pointed out. {\textcopyright} 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {In standard fluid dynamics, the density change associated with flow is often assumed to be negligible, implying that the fluid is incompressible. For example, this has been established for simple shear flows, where no pressure change is associated with flow: there is no volume deformation due to viscous stress and inertial effects can be neglected. Accordingly, any flow-induced instabilities (such as cavitation) are unexpected for simple shear flows. Here we demonstrate that the incompressibility condition can be violated even for simple shear flows, by taking into account the coupling between the flow and density fluctuations, which arises owing to the density dependence of the viscosity. We show that a liquid can become mechanically unstable above a critical shear rate that is given by the inverse of the derivative of viscosity with respect to pressure. Our model predicts that, for very viscous liquids, this shear-induced instability should occur at moderate shear rates that are experimentally accessible. Our results explain the unusual shear-induced instability observed in viscous lubricants, and may illuminate other poorly understood phenomena associated with mechanical instability of liquids at low Reynolds number; for example, shear-induced cavitation and bubble growth, and shear-banding of very viscous liquids such as metallic glasses and the Earth's mantle. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

The former is subject to a dynamic boundary condition recently proposed by some physicists to account for interactions with the walls. The latter is endowed with a boundary condition which can be a standard one (Dirichlet, Neumann or Robin) or a dynamic one of Wentzell type. We thus formulate a class of initial and boundary value problems whose local existence and uniqueness is proven by means of a fixed point argument. The local solution becomes global owing to suitable a priori estimates. Then we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the solutions within the theory of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of the global attractor as well as of an exponential attractor.},

For a better description of short-range interactions of the material with the solid wall, various dynamic boundary conditions have been considered in recent times. New models with dynamic boundary conditions have been proposed recently by C. Liu and H. Wu [arXiv:1710.08318]. We prove the existence of weak solutions to these new models by interpreting the problem as a suitable gradient flow of a total free energy which contains volume as well as surface contributions. The formulation involves an inner product which couples bulk and surface quantities in an appropriate way. We use an implicit time discretization and show that the obtained approximate solutions converge to a weak solution of the Cahn-Hilliard system. This allows us to substantially improve earlier results which needed strong assumptions on the geometry of the domain. Furthermore, we prove that this weak solution is unique.},

The well-posedness of the system equipped with Neumann boundary conditions was found to require regular potentials with quadratic growth. In this work, Dirichlet boundary conditions are considered, and we establish the well-posedness of the system for regular potentials with higher polynomial growth and also for singular potentials. New difficulties are encountered due to the higher polynomial growth, but for regular potentials, we retain the continuous dependence on initial and boundary data for the chemical potential and for the order parameter in strong norms as established in the previous work. Furthermore, we deduce the well-posedness of a variant of the model with quasi-static nutrient by rigorously passing to the limit where the ratio of the nutrient diffusion time-scale to the tumor doubling time-scale is small.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery has been performed because of its advantages such as less invasive surgical management and more aggressive tumor removal of extrasellar lesions. In 2003, we began endoscope-assisting surgery. In 2006, we completely switched to the endoscopic endonasal approach without microscope or nasal specula. Today, we report endoscopic pituitary and skull base surgery in our institute. The endonasal approach via the sphenoid ostium was carried out without nasal specula. Postoperative nasal packing was basically not needed in such cases. In cases with meningiomas, craniopharyngiomas and giant pituitary adenomas, which needed intra-dural procedure, nasal procedures such as middle nasal conchotomy, posterior ethmoidectomy and skull base techniques such as optic canal decompression and removal of the planum sphenoidale were carried out to gain the wider operative field toward anterior skull base and lower clivus. Navigation and US-Doppler were essential. Angled endoscope attained more successful removal of tumor under direct visualization extending into the cavernous sinus (GH secreting ademomas) and lower clivus (chordoma). In the case of CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) leakage during operation, a newly designed balloon catheter was placed in the sphenoid sinus to fix the abdominal fat and fibrin glue at the leakage point. In recent cases, dural opening has been sutured. In the combination of such techniques, a lumbar drainage system to prevent postoperative CSF rhinorrhea became needless in many cases. Angled suction tips, single-shaft coagulation tools and slim and longer holding forceps, all of which were newly designed for endoscopic surgery, were essential for smoother procedure. Endonasal endoscopic pituitary surgery has resulted in less invasive transsphenoidal surgery since no postoperative nasal packing is needed and there is less dependency on lumbar drainage. Although better techniques to prevent postoperative CSF leakage needs to be developed, this endoscopic pituitary surgery will become more common and will become a standard procedure. Endoscopic skull base surgery has enabled more aggressive removal of extrasellar tumors with the aid of nasal and skull base techniques. This endoscopic skull base surgery is more highly specialized, needs special techniques and surgical training. Selection of patients is also important. This also needs collaboration with ENT (ear, nose, throat) doctors. To be acknowledged as a safe and successful procedure in skull base surgery, this complex procedure may be preferably carried out only in center hospitals, which deal with many patients with a skull base lesion.},

However, in the case of non-permeable walls, one should also expect some mass on the boundary. It thus seems more realistic to assume that the total mass, in the bulk and on the boundary, is conserved, which leads to boundary conditions of a different type. For the resulting mathematical model, we prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions and study their asymptotic behavior as time goes to infinity. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We allow the anisotropy to be strong enough that missing orientations would be present in equilibrium configurations, and track the unstable evolution of an initially planar front to a facetted front. Regularization by curvature-dependent surface energy is posed, and in the nonlinear regime a convective Cahn-Hilliard equation is derived. The emergence of facets is thus related to spinodal decomposition and subsequent coarsening. The presence of convective terms generated by the effect of kinetics destroys the binodal construction and leads to a fast coarsening, that for large times t goes as t 1/2. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The Cahn-Hilliard equation involves fourth-order spatial derivatives. Finite element solutions are not common because primal variational formulations of fourth-order operators are only well defined and integrable if the finite element basis functions are piecewise smooth and globally C1-continuous. There are a very limited number of two-dimensional finite elements possessing C1-continuity applicable to complex geometries, but none in three-dimensions. We propose isogeometric analysis as a technology that possesses a unique combination of attributes for complex problems involving higher-order differential operators, namely, higher-order accuracy, robustness, two- and three-dimensional geometric flexibility, compact support, and, most importantly, the possibility of C1and higher-order continuity. A NURBS-based variational formulation for the Cahn-Hilliard equation was tested on two- and three-dimensional problems. We present steady state solutions in two-dimensions and, for the first time, in three-dimensions. To achieve these results an adaptive time-stepping method is introduced. We also present a technique for desensitizing calculations to dependence on mesh refinement. This enables the calculation of topologically correct solutions on coarse meshes, opening the way to practical engineering applications of phase-field methodology. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

When a spatially homogeneous alloy is rapidly quenched in a physical experiment, a fine-grained decomposition into two distinct phases is frequently observed; this phenomenon is known as spinodal decomposition. A simple linear analysis about an unstable homogeneous equilibrium of the one-dimensional Cahn-Hilliard equation gives heuris- tic evidence that most solutions that start with initial data near such an equilibrium exhibit a behavior corresponding to spinodal decomposi- tion. In this paper we formulate this conjecture in amathematically pre- cise way, using geometric and measure-theoretic techniques, and prove its validity.

The latter can be of hyperbolic type if the Cattaneo-Maxwell heat conduction law is assumed. The state variables and the chemical potential are subject to the homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions.

abstract = {We study the modified Cahn-Hilliard equation proposed by Galenko et al. in order to account for rapid spinodal decomposition in certain glasses. This equation contains, as additional term, the second-order time derivative of the (relative) concentration multiplied by a (small) positive coefficient $\epsilon$ . Thus, in absence of viscosity effects, we are in presence of a Petrovsky type equation and the solutions do not regularize in finite time. Many results are known in one spatial dimension. However, even in two spatial dimensions, the problem of finding a unique solution satisfying given initial and boundary conditions is far from being trivial. A fairly complete analysis of the 2D case has been recently carried out by Grasselli, Schimperna and Zelik. The 3D case is still rather poorly understood but for the existence of energy bounded solutions. Taking advantage of this fact, Segatti has investigated the asymptotic behavior of a generalized dynamical system which can be associated with the equation. Here we take a step further by establishing the existence and uniqueness of a global weak solution, provided that $\epsilon$ is small enough. More precisely, we show that there exists $\epsilon$-0 {\textgreater} 0 such that well-posedness holds if (suitable) norms of the initial data are bounded by a positive function of $\epsilon$$\backslash$in (0, $\epsilon$-0) which goes to + ∞ as $\epsilon$ tends to 0. This result allows us to construct a semigroup S-$\epsilon$ t on an appropriate (bounded) phase space and, besides, to prove the existence of a global attractor. Finally, we show a regularity result for the attractor by using a decomposition method and we discuss the existence of an exponential attractor. {\textcopyright} 2009 Birkh{\"{a}}user Verlag Basel/Switzerland.},

This problem is equivalent to estimating the weak solution of the limiting McKean-Vlasov SDE. To that end, our approach uses systems with finite numbers of particles and a time-stepping scheme. In this case, there are two discretization parameters: the number of time steps and the number of particles. Based on these two parameters, we consider different variants of the Monte Carlo and Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods and show that, in the best case, the optimal work complexity of MLMC, to estimate the functional in one typical setting with an error tolerance of {\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}TOL{\}}{\$}, is {\$}\backslashmathcal O\backslashleft({\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}TOL{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\}}\backslashright){\$} when using the partitioning estimator and the Milstein time-stepping scheme.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Generic boundary conditions for hard walls are considered, as they are derived from physical principles. Based on a detailed stability analysis an automatic time step control could be implemented, which makes it possible to explore the demixing kinetics of two thermodynamically stable phases over many orders in time with good space resolution. The power of the method is demonstrated by investigating spinodal decomposition in two-dimensional systems. At early times of the decomposition process the numerical results are in excellent agreement with analytical predictions based on the linearized equations. Due to the efficiency of the variable time step procedure it is possible to monitor the process until a stable equilibrium is reached.},

In the phase field approach, the classical sharp-interface between the two immiscible fluids is replaced by a transition region across which the properties of fluids change continuously. The proposed method incorporates a chemical potential which can eliminate the unphysical phase field profile and a continuous surface tension force formulation from which we can calculate the pressure field directly from the governing equations. The capabilities of the method are demonstrated with several examples. We compute the ternary phase separation via spinodal decomposition, equilibrium phase field profiles, pressure field distribution, and a three-interface contact angle resulting from a spreading liquid lens on an interface.

abstract = {Situational awareness is often a matter of detailed local information and proportionally limited view on the bigger picture. Conversely, the big picture avoids complicating details, and as such displays the system components as atomic “black boxes”. This work proposes a combination of local and global views, accounting for a common practical division of physical and cyber domains, each of which have their own group of experts and management processes. We identify a small set of data items that is required about the physical and cyber parts of a system, along with a high-level description of how these parts interoperate. From these three ingredients, which we call physical, cyber and hybrid “awareness” (meaning just knowledge about what is there), we construct a simulation model to study cascading effects and indirect implications of distortions in a cyber-physical system. Our simulation model is composed from coupled Mealy automata, and we show an instance of it using a small cyber-physical infrastructure. This extends the awareness from “knowing what is” to “knowing what could happen next”, and as such addresses a core duty of effective risk management. Manifold extensions to this model are imaginable and discussed in the aftermath of the definition and example demonstration.},

abstract = {High-temperature superconductors have a lot of promising applications: quantum computers, high-performance classical computers, green energy, safe and high-speed transportation system, medical appliance, and etc. However, to discover new superconductors is very difficult. It is said that only {\$}3\backslash{\%}{\$} of candidate materials become superconductors. We do not have satisfactory theory of high-temperature superconductors yet, and computational methods do not work either. On the other hand, the data has accumulated. Deep learning suits the situation. We introduce following two methods into deep learning: (1) in order to better represent material information and make good use of our scientific knowledge into deep learning, we introduce the input data form representing "material as image from periodic table with four channels corresponding to s, p, d, and f of electron orbit", (2) we introduce the method, named "garbage-in", to make use of the non-annotated data, which means the data of materials without any critical temperature {\$}T{\_}c{\$} in this case. We show that the critical temperature is well predicted by deep learning. In order to test the ability of the deep neural network it is good if we have the list of materials, which it is hard to tell whether they become superconductors or not from human expert in advance. We use the list made by Hosono's group as such. The test is to predict if a material becomes superconductor beyond {\$}10{\$} Kelvin or not, and the neural network is trained by the data before the list was made. The neural network achieved accuracy {\$}94\backslash{\%}{\$}, precision {\$}74\backslash{\%}{\$}, recall {\$}62\backslash{\%}{\$}, and f1 score {\$}67\backslash{\%}{\$}. Compared to the baseline precision {\$}9\backslash{\%}{\$}, which is obtained from a positive prediction to randomly selected material, our deep learning has very good precision. We make a list of candidate materials of superconductors, and we are preparing for the experiments now.},

There are many studies for the case where the real part of its nonlinear term plays as dissipation. This dissipative case is intensively studied and it is shown that (CGL) admits a global solution when parameters appearing in (CGL) belong to the so-called CGL-region. This paper deals with the non-dissipative case. We regard (CGL) as a parabolic equation perturbed by monotone and non-monotone perturbations and follows the basic strategy developed in {\^{O}}tani (1982) to show the local well-posedness of (CGL) and the existence of small global solutions provided that the nonlinearity is the Sobolev subcritical.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes the newly developed immersed finite element method (IFEM) and its applications to the modeling of biological systems. This work was inspired by the pioneering work of Professor T.J.R. Hughes in solving fluid-structure interaction problems. In IFEM, a Lagrangian solid mesh moves on top of a background Eulerian fluid mesh which spans the entire computational domain. Hence, mesh generation is greatly simplified. Moreover, both fluid and solid domains are modeled with the finite element method and the continuity between the fluid and solid sub-domains is enforced via the interpolation of the velocities and the distribution of the forces with the reproducing Kernel particle method (RKPM) delta function. The proposed method is used to study the fluid-structure interaction problems encountered in human cardiovascular systems. Currently, the heart modeling is being constructed and the deployment process of an angioplasty stent has been simulated. Some preliminary results on monocyte and platelet deposition are presented. Blood rheology, in particular, the shear-rate dependent de-aggregation of red blood cell (RBC) clusters and the transport of deformable cells, are modeled. Furthermore, IFEM is combined with electrokinetics to study the mechanisms of nano/bio filament assembly for the understanding of cell motility. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Miller1991,
abstract = {The problem of measuring the viscosity of fluids under shock-loading conditions is discussed. The authors examine in detail the method of Sakharov et al. (1965) and Zaidel' (1967) for measuring shear viscosity from the decay of perturbations on a corrugated shock front. The relevance of initial conditions, finite shock amplitude, bulk viscosity, and the sensitivity of the measurements to the shock boundary conditions are discussed. The validity of the viscous perturbation approach is examined by numerically solving the second-order Navier-Stokes equations. These numerical experiments indicate that shock instabilities may occur even when the Kontorovich-D'yakov stability criteria are satsified. The corrugated shock front induces mixing of the shocked sample. This mixing is particularly vigorous in viscous materials and may be responsible for the rapid rate of some shock-induced chemical reactions. The experimental results for water at 15 GPa are discussed, and several possibilities are considered to explain why the viscosity obtained by these experiments is so different from those obtained by other methods. Two possible reasons are favored: (1) the analytic method may be inappropriate because it ignores possible complications at the onset of the shock perturbations, and (2) the large effective viscosity determined by this method may reflect the existence of ice VII on the Rayleigh path of the Hugoniot. The latter interpretation reconciles the experimental results with estimates and measurements obtained by other means and is consistent with pressure-volume-temperature Hugoniot data and the phase diagram of H2O. {\textcopyright} 1991 The American Physical Society.},

@article{MittalIaccarino2005,
abstract = {The term immersed boundary methodwas first used in reference to a method de- veloped by Peskin (1972) to simulate cardiac mechanics and associated blood flow. The distinguishing feature of this methodwas that the entire simulationwas carried out on a Cartesian grid, which did not conform to the geometry of the heart, and a novel procedurewas formulated for imposing the effect of the immersed boundary (IB) on the flow. Since Peskin introduced this method, numerous modifications and refinements have been proposed and a number of variants of this approach nowex- ist. In addition, there is another class of methods, usually referred to as Cartesian grid methods, which were originally developed for simulating inviscid flows with complex embedded solid boundaries on Cartesian grids (Berger{\&}Aftosmis 1998, Clarke et al. 1986, Zeeuw {\&} Powell 1991). These methods have been extended to simulate unsteady viscous flows (Udaykumar et al. 1996, Ye et al. 1999) and thus have capabilities similar to those of IB methods. In this review, we use the term im- mersed boundary (IB) method to encompass all such methods that simulate viscous flows with immersed (or embedded) boundaries on grids that do not conform to the shape of these boundaries. Furthermore, this review focuses mainly on IB meth- ods for flows with immersed solid boundaries. Application of these and related methods to problems with liquid-liquid and liquid-gas boundaries was covered in previous reviews by Anderson et al. (1998) and Scardovelli {\&} Zaleski (1999). Consider the simulation of flow past a solid body shown in Figure 1a. The conventional approach to this would employ structured or unstructured grids that conform to the body. Generating these grids proceeds in two sequential steps. First, a surface grid covering the boundaries b is generated. This is then used as a boundary condition to generate a grid in the volumef occupied by the fluid. If a finite-difference method is employed on a structured grid, then the differential form of the governing equations is transformed to a curvilinear coordinate system aligned with the grid lines (Ferziger {\&} Peric 1996). Because the grid conforms to the surface of the body, the transformed equations can then be discretized in the 0066-4189/05/0115-0239{\$}14.00 239 Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech. 2005.37:239-261.

We study the shape of a local minimizer of the problem E(u) = ∫D (|▽u|2/2 + $\lambda$W(u)) dx subject to m = 1/|D| ∫D udx and study the global structure of critical points. We show that for an arbitrary potential W ∈ C4 every level set of every nonconstant local minimizer is a C1-curve and it divides D into exactly two simply connected subdomains. Next we consider the case W(u) = (u2 - 1)2/4 (Cahn-Hilliard equation). When $\lambda$ varies and m is fixed, we show that this problem has an unbounded continuum of critical points. When m varies and $\lambda$ is fixed, we show that this problem has a bounded continuum meeting at two different points on the trivial branch. Moreover, we show that in each case a bifurcating critical point is stable (a local minimizer) near the bifurcation point in a certain parameter range. The main technique is the nodal curve which relates the shape with the Morse index. We do not use a small parameter or the F-convergence technique.},

In addition, this line has a certain threshold value in respect to the signal height, and signals smaller than the threshold or noise are eliminated in the course of transmission. Because of the above-mentioned shaping action and the existence of a threshold, this line makes possible highly reliable pulse transmission, and will be useful for various kinds of information-processing systems.},

abstract = {The public benefit of test-and-treat has induced a need to justify goodness for the public, and mathematical modeling studies have played a key role in designing and evaluating the test-and-treat strategy for controlling HIV/AIDS. Here we briefly and comprehensively review the essence of contemporary understanding of the test-and-treat policy through mathematical modeling approaches and identify key pitfalls that have been identified to date. While the decrease in HIV incidence is achieved with certain coverages of diagnosis, care and continued treatment, HIV prevalence is not necessarily decreased and sometimes the test-and-treat is accompanied by increased long-term cost of antiretroviral therapy (ART). To confront with the complexity of assessment on this policy, the elimination threshold or the effective reproduction number has been proposed for its use in determining the overall success to anticipate the eventual elimination. Since the publication of original model in 2009, key issues of test-and-treat modeling studies have been identified, including theoretical problems surrounding the sexual partnership network, heterogeneities in the transmission dynamics, and realistic issues of achieving and maintaining high treatment coverage in the most hard-to-reach populations. To explicitly design country-specific control policy, quantitative modeling approaches to each single setting with differing epidemiological context would require multi-disciplinary collaborations among clinicians, public health practitioners, laboratory technologists, epidemiologists and mathematical modelers.},

abstract = {Objectives Despite the verification of measles elimination, Japan experienced multiple generations of measles transmission following importation events in 2016. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the transmission dynamics of measles in Japan, 2016, estimating the transmission potential in the partially vaccinated population. Methods All diagnosed measles cases were notified to the government, and the present study analyzed two pieces of datasets independently, i.e., the transmission tree of the largest outbreak in Osaka (n = 49) and the final size distribution of all importation events (n = 23 events). Branching process model was employed to estimate the effective reproduction number Rv, and the analysis of transmission tree in Osaka enabled us to account for the timing of introducing contact tracing and case isolation. Results Employing a negative binomial distribution for the offspring distribution, the model with time-dependent decline in Rv due to interventions appeared to best fit to the transmission tree data with Rv of 9.20 (95{\%} CI (confidence interval): 2.08, 150.68) and the dispersion parameter 0.32 (95{\%} CI: 0.07, 1.17) before interventions were introduced. The relative transmissibility in the presence of interventions from week 34 was estimated at 0.005. Analyzing the final size distribution, models for subcritical and supercritical processes fitted equally well to the observed data, and the estimated reproduction number from both models did not exclude the possibility that Rv {\textgreater} 1. Conclusions Our results likely reflect the highly contagious nature of measles, indicating that Japan is at risk of observing multiple generations of measles transmission given imported cases. Considering that importation events may continue in the future, supplementary vaccination of adults needs to be considered.},

abstract = {Background: A large epidemic of cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae, serotype Ogawa, has been ongoing in Yemen, 2017. To improve the situation awareness, the present study aimed to forecast the cholera epidemic, explicitly addressing the reporting delay and ascertainment bias. Methods: Using weekly incidence of suspected cases, updated as a revised epidemic curve every week, the reporting delay was explicitly incorporated into the estimation model. Using the weekly case fatality risk as calculated by the World Health Organization, ascertainment bias was adjusted, enabling us to parameterize the family of logistic curves (i.e., logistic and generalized logistic models) for describing the unbiased incidence in 2017. Results: The cumulative incidence at the end of the epidemic, was estimated at 790,778 (95{\%} CI: 700,495, 914,442) cases and 767,029 (95{\%} CI: 690,877, 871,671) cases, respectively, by using logistic and generalized logistic models. It was also estimated that we have just passed through the epidemic peak by week 26, 2017. From week 27 onwards, the weekly incidence was predicted to decrease. Conclusions: Cholera epidemic in Yemen, 2017 was predicted to soon start to decrease. If the weekly incidence is reported in the up-to-the-minute manner and updated in later weeks, not a single data point but the entire epidemic curve must be precisely updated.},

abstract = {This chapter focuses on the Cahn–Hilliard equation. In the context of the Cahn–Hilliard equation, the two components could refer, for example, to a system with two metallic components, or two polymer components, or say, two glassy components. Frequently in materials science literature, concentration is given in terms of mole fraction or equivalently number fraction, rather than in terms of volume fraction or mass fraction. A mole refers to 6.02252×1023 molecules (Avogadro's number of molecules), and the mole fraction of component A refers to the number of A molecules per mole of the two component system, locally evaluated. Mole fraction of number fraction is equivalent to volume fraction if the molar volume (the volume occupied by one mole) is independent of composition, which is rarely strictly correct. The Cahn–Hilliard equation also appears in modeling many other phenomena. These include the evolution of two components of intergalactic material, the dynamics of two populations, the biomathematical modeling of a bacterial film, and certain thin film problems.},

Natural boundary conditions are introduced. The full set of equilibrium solutions is specified. A comparison theorem for stability criteria which was postulated by Langer is proved here within the framework of the natural boundary conditions. Energy methods are used to define and estimate the limit of monotonic global stability. It is pointed out that within the parameter region where the uniform homogeneous state is the only equilibrium solution, there may still exist some internal "excitable" region in which the homogeneous solution possesses growing fluctuations. Furthermore a periodic instability is shown to exist in the metastable region in addition to the well-known nucleation instability. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

The task force's previous papers [1, 2] are focused on general aspects of cascading outages such as understanding, prediction, prevention and restoration from cascading failures. This is the second of two new papers, which extend this previous work to summarize the state of the art in cascading failure risk analysis methodologies and modeling tools. The first paper reviews the state of the art in methodologies for performing risk assessment of potential cascading outages [3]. This paper describes the state of the art in cascading failure modeling tools, documenting the view of experts representing utilities, universities and consulting companies. The paper is intended to constitute a valid source of information and references about presently available tools that deal with prediction of cascading failure events. This effort involves reviewing published literature and other documentation from vendors, universities and research institutions. The assessment of cascading outages risk evaluation is in continuous evolution. Investigations to gain even better understanding and identification of cascading events are the subject of several research programs underway aimed at solving the complexity of these events that electrical utilities face today. Assessing the risk of cascading failure events in planning and operation for power transmission systems require adequate mathematical tools/software. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {The buffered peptone water (BPW) containing 0.5{\%} sodium thioglycolate (BPWST) as enrichment broth in combination with BPW as pre-enrichment broth for strains of Salmonella from radish sprouts was evaluated. False-positive colonies were found on CHROMagar Salmonella agar used as an isolation medium in 28 out of 30 radish sprout samples (93{\%}) on incubation using BPW, while such colonies were found in 3 samples (17{\%}) using BPWST. The growth of non-starved and starved Salmonella strains in BPWST was found to range from 10 5 -10 7 CFU/ml, while non-starved Pseudomonas which produces false-positive colonies was markedly inhibited, at {\textless}100 CFU/ml. All starved inoculated Salmonella strains were recovered from radish sprouts, and they were detected in small numbers on starved Salmonella inoculation using both BPW as pre-enrichment and BPWST as enrichment （BPW-BPWST method）. The use of the BPW-BPWST method is effective for the isolation of Salmonella from radish sprouts. It is thought that the findings obtained from this study can be applied for the isolation of Salmonella from environments and various hydroponically cultivated raw vegetables.},

abstract = {Colon carcinoma is one of the leading causes of death from cancer and is characterized by a heterogenic pool of cells with distinct differentiation patterns. Recently, it was reported that a population of undifferentiated cells from a primary tumor, so-called cancer stem cells (CSC), can reconstitute the original tumor on xenotransplantation. Here, we show that spheroid cultures of these colon CSCs contain expression of CD133, CD166, CD44, CD29, CD24, Lgr5, and nuclear beta-catenin, which have all been suggested to mark the (cancer) stem cell population. More importantly, by using these spheroid cultures or freshly isolated tumor cells from multiple colon carcinomas, we now provide compelling evidence to indicate that the capacity to propagate a tumor with all differentiated progeny resides in a single CSC. Single-cell-cloned CSCs can form an adenocarcinoma on xenotransplantation but do not generate the stroma within these tumors. Moreover, they can self-renew and are capable of multilineage differentiation. Further analysis indicated that the lineage decision is dictated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling in CSCs. These data support the hypothesis that tumor hierarchy can be traced back to a single CSC that contains multilineage differentiation capacity, and provides clues to the regulation of differentiation in colon cancers in vivo.},

We demonstrate that in this strongly dissipative system, the transition happens either via an absolute or a convective instability depending on the laser parameters. In the latter case, the transition occurs via formation of localised structures in the laminar regime, which trigger the formation of growing and drifting puffs of turbulence. Experimentally, we demonstrate that these turbulent bursts are seeded by appearance of Nozaki-Bekki holes, characterised by the zero field amplitude and {\&}{\#}x003C0; phase jumps. Our experimental results are supported with numerical simulations based on the delay differential equations model.},

abstract = {The main concern of the present paper is to analyze a sheath formed around a surface of a material with which plasma contacts. Here, for a formation of the sheath, the Bohm criterion requires the velocity of positive ions should be faster than a certain physical constant. The behavior of positive ions in plasma is governed by the Euler-Poisson equations. Mathematically, the sheath is regarded as a special stationary solution. We first show that the Bohm criterion gives a sufficient condition for an existence of the stationary solution by using the phase plane analysis. Then it is shown that the stationary solution is time asymptotically stable provided that an initial perturbation is sufficiently small in the weighted Sobolev space. Moreover we obtain the convergence rate of the time global solution towards the stationary solution subject to the decay rate of the initial perturbation. These theorems are proved by a weighted energy method. {\textcopyright} American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.},

The exponent m is approximately 4 for all materials while the coefficient a is material dependent. A model is developed which incorporates the observed trends of the shock viscosity data in a three-dimensional framework. Finite-difference calculations using the model reproduce the experimental wave profile data.},

We aim to verify how this computation originated gapless point could be understood based on physics, using the quantum Monte Carlo method. As a result, we found a phase transition detectable only by the divergence of fidelity susceptibility. The exponentially small gapless points of each instance are all located in the phase found in this study, which suggests that this phase transition is the physical cause of the failure of QA for NP-hard problems.},

In this brief, based on the cascading failure model which considers both the network topology and electrical characteristics running in power grids, we study how the topological metrics affect the robustness of power grids. The topological metrics considered include both the connectivity of the network and the distribution of generators. We compare the results in typical complex network models and an IEEE 118-bus network. Moreover, by using the simulated annealing method, we find the optimal network topology to achieve the best network robustness, and compare the topological metrics before and after the optimization to verify our findings. The results show that, in order to enhance the robustness of power grids, it is better to make the network sparsely connected, and place the generators as hubs and decentralize these generators.},

@article{Ursell2007a,
abstract = {My interest in this subject has been long standing, but only recently has my research been pushing me towards a more quantitative understanding of this material. A great many systems, both physical and abstract, have constituents with specific energetic interactions. When a system of such interacting particles is subject to fluctuations of a well-defined spectrum (e.g. an exponential distribution of energy, like Boltzmann statistics) the system attempts to maximize its degree of disorder in a way that is proportional to the magnitude of these fluctuations (i.e. temperature). This is, of course, the notion of entropy, and the origin of the energetic term −T S in thermodynamic potentials. Simultaneously, each particle in the system is trying to minimize its energy of interaction with neighboring particles, setting up a competition between the entropy of mixing and the enthalpic benefit of having certain preferred neighbors. This competition leads to a temperature-dependent phase transition. In the case explored below, this is a so-called 'order-disorder' or 'second-order' transition. Effectively, this means that below a certain critical temperature (or critical value of some other parameter in the system) particles in the system will organize themselves such that enthalpy is minimized. Most often, the specific interactions are such that like-likes-like, hence particles organize spatially by similar type to form unique phases. The purpose of this tutorial is both to understand some aspects of this entropy-enthalpy competition and subsequently the kinetics of phase separation. 2 Derivation of the Cahn-Hilliard Equation For the purposes of this tutorial let us assume we are dealing with a 2D binary fluid composed of A and B particles in the limit where diffusion is the major transport mechanism (as opposed to hydrodynamics). Let us define the order-parameter field $\phi$ such that $\phi$ = 1 is a phase completely made of A particles, and $\phi$ = −1 is a phase completely made of B particles, with a linear interpolation between those two phases. We assume the interactions of AA and BB are favorable, while AB = BA are unfavorable. If a particle A and a particle B are interacting, this means there is an unfavorable energy associated with a gradient in the field $\phi$. Obviously, the direction of that gradient does not matter (i.e. we have rotational symmetry) and we want energy and its derivatives to be well-defined, thus gradients in the field must be energetically penalized by ||$\phi$| 2 to obey that symmetry.},

Very low friction is only found over the limited temperature range typical for ice skating. The strong decrease in the friction coefficient with increasing temperature exhibits Arrhenius behavior with an activation energy of Ea ≈ 11.5 kJ mol-1. Remarkably, molecular dynamics simulations of the ice-air interface reveal a very similar activation energy for the mobility of surface molecules. Weakly hydrogen-bonded surface molecules diffuse over the surface in a rolling motion, their number and mobility increasing with increasing temperature. This correlation between macroscopic friction and microscopic molecular mobility indicates that slippery ice arises from the high mobility of its surface molecules, making the ice surface smooth and the shearing of the weakly bonded surface molecules easy.},

abstract = {A system of two operator equations is considered-one of pseudomonotone type and the other of strongly monotone type-both being strongly coupled. Conditions are given that allow to reduce the solvability of this system to a single operator equation of a pseudomonotone mapping. This result is applied to a coupled system consisting of a parabolic equation of fourth order in space of Cahn-Hilliard type and a nonlinear elliptic equation of second order modeling a quasi-steady mechanical equilibrium. Using an appropriate notion of weak solutions and a framework for evolution equations developed by Gr{\"{o}}ger (2001), the system is reduced to a single parabolic operator equation and the existence of solutions is shown under restrictions on the strength of the coupling.},

Willis (1969). The thermodynamic system, which was left open in the general framework, is taken to be that proposed recently by G.W. Swan and C.K. Thornhill (1974). Results are presented for oblique loading of a block of low carbon steel. For an imposed normal velocity of the order of 1,100 m s-1, a smooth shear wave behind the shock that is formed is possible only for small transverse velocities, perhaps no greater than 14 m s-1, depending upon the value assumed for the yield stress. Larger transverse velocities would give rise to a thin layer of intense shear near the surface of the block, whose study would require allowance for both work-hardening and temperature-dependent yield stress. {\textcopyright} 1975.},

The upper branch consists of a decreasing solution and the lower branch consists of an increasing solution. In particular, we show the following equation $\Delta$u+$\lambda$(u-u|u|p-1)=0in B,∂u/∂$\nu$=0 on ∂B has exactly two monotone radial nodal solutions, one is decreasing and the other is increasing.

abstract = {A modified SIMPER algorithm is developed for analysis of microfluid effects on the motion and deformation of a red blood cell (RBC) in a capillary. With consideration of very small Reynolds number in microfluidics, this algorithm not only speeds up the convergence of the momentum equations by combining the advantages of the SIMPLEC and SIMPLER algorithms together, but also satisfies the continuity equation with higher accuracy by integrating a fine adjustment technique. In order to validate the modified SIMPLER algorithm, the behavior of RBC in a capillary is simulated at different velocities. When the mean RBC velocity is 0.1. mm/s, the RBC exhibits a characteristic parachute shape in the steady state, which agrees well with the numerical results previously reported. Apart from that, a quantitative validation with the experimental data is performed by examining the relationship between the mean velocity and deformation index of the RBC, showing an excellent agreement. The effects of crucial parameters are investigated systematically on the motion and deformation of the RBC, including the RBC radius, elastic modulus and bending stiffness of RBC membrane, initial velocity of suspending fluid, as well as the density and viscosity ratios of the suspending fluid to RBC. The simulation results demonstrate that all of the parameters have influences on the RBC behavior by changing the interaction between the RBC and suspending fluid. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},
